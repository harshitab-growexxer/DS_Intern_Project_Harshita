1. Strong Positive Correlations:
   - `hpc_outlet_temp` and `lpc_outlet_temp`: 0.982
   - `hpc_outlet_temp` and `core_speed`: 0.998
   - `fan_inlet_temp` and `altitude`: -0.964
   - `fan_inlet_temp` and `mach_no`: -0.884
   - `hpt_coolant_bleed` and `fan_inlet_temp`: 0.977
   - `bleed_enthalpy` and `lpc_outlet_temp`: 0.983
   - `burner_fuel_air_ratio` and `altitude`: -0.839

2. Strong Negative Correlations:
   - `fan_inlet_temp` and `altitude`: -0.964
   - `fan_inlet_temp` and `mach_no`: -0.884
   - `bypass_ratio` and `fan_speed`: -0.971
   - `corrected_fan_speed` and `fan_speed`: 0.902
   - `burner_fuel_air_ratio` and `bypass_ratio`: -0.664

Significant Correlations:
- `hpc_outlet_temp` and `lpc_outlet_temp` (0.982): High positive correlation indicating these two temperatures are closely related.
- `core_speed` and `hpc_outlet_temp` (0.998): Almost perfect positive correlation showing a strong relationship between core speed and high-pressure compressor outlet temperature.
- `altitude` and `fan_inlet_temp` (-0.964): High negative correlation suggesting that as altitude increases, the fan inlet temperature decreases.
- `mach_no` and `fan_inlet_temp` (-0.884): High negative correlation indicating that higher mach numbers are associated with lower fan inlet temperatures.
- `hpt_coolant_bleed` and `fan_inlet_temp` (0.977): Very high positive correlation, showing that as fan inlet temperature increases, so does high-pressure turbine coolant bleed.
- `bleed_enthalpy` and `lpc_outlet_temp` (0.983): Strong positive correlation indicating a strong relationship between bleed enthalpy and low-pressure compressor outlet temperature.
- `burner_fuel_air_ratio` and `altitude` (-0.839): High negative correlation showing a strong relationship between burner fuel/air ratio and altitude.

Key Correlation with Remaining Useful Life (RUL):
- `cycles_completed` and `RUL` (-0.733): High negative correlation indicating that as cycles completed increase, the remaining useful life decreases significantly.



A low pressure compressor (LPC) and high pressure compressor (HPC) supply compressed high temperature, high pressure gases to the combustor. 
Low pressure turbine (LPT) can decelerate and pressurize air to improve the chemical energy conversion efficiency of aviation kerosene. 
High pressure turbines (HPT) generate mechanical energy by using high temperature and high pressure gas strike turbine blades. 
Low-pressure rotor (N1), high-pressure rotor (N2), and nozzle guarantee the combustion efficiency of the engine.
