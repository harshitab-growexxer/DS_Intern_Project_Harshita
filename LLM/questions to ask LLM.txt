How many engines are included in the dataset?

What is the distribution of cycles (operational time) for these engines?

What are the minimum, maximum, and average RUL (Remaining Useful Life) values in the dataset?

Which features are most correlated with the target variable RUL?

Can you identify any multicollinearity issues among the input features?

Are there specific engines or operational conditions where the model performs significantly better or worse?

Which features have the highest importance in predicting RUL according to the LLM model?

Are there any surprising or counterintuitive relationships between the input features and RUL that the model highlights?

What is the distribution of engine types in the dataset?
        
How many cycles of data do we have for each engine?

What is the range of cycles (operating time) covered in the dataset?

What are the average values of important parameters like altitude, Mach number, and throttle angle across all engines?

How do changes in altitude and Mach number affect engine performance parameters like temperatures and pressures?

What is a turbofan engine?

Show me the average temperature recorded.

List all sensor readings from engine ID 3.

What is the maximum pressure observed across all engines?

Show me the temperature readings where engine ID is greater than 5.

List all engines where the fan speed is less than 2000.

Retrieve all sensor readings when the cycles are between 100 and 200.

Retrieve the highest and lowest temperature readings recorded for each engine.

what is the standard deviation of cycles?

what is the correlation between lpc outlet temp and hpc outlet temp ?

are there any outliers in the data?

are there any null values in the data?
