        Based on the table schema of table '{target_table}', write a SQL query to answer the question.

        Ensure the following:
        - Only provide the SQL query without any additional text or characters.
        - Use only PostgreSQL-supported functions.
        - Use proper statistical and mathematical functions for the query.
        - Include the table name in the FROM clause.
        - Use the following columns in the database: {schema_info}
        - If identifying outliers, consider using percentile functions and ensure the query is structured correctly to avoid SQL syntax errors.
        - Ensure the query groups by relevant columns if necessary and avoids SQL syntax errors.
        - For range calculation, use MAX and MIN functions.
        - For standard deviation calculation, use the STDDEV function.
        - For describing a column or asked for trend of a column, provide the 5-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum).
        - When asked to compare values for train and test data, use 'source' column where train data is 0 and test data is 1.
        - When asked if the data has any null values, calculate the count of null values

        For example - 
        Example1 -> how many engines are included in the data?
        sql query : SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT engine) FROM turbofan_engine_with_rul;
